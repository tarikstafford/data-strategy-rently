## Development Workflow

### Overview
The Rently lending platform follows a structured development workflow designed to maintain code quality, ensure regulatory compliance, and support continuous deployment in a financial services environment.

### Core Principles
- **Data Integrity First**: All changes must preserve data integrity and financial accuracy
- **Security by Design**: Security considerations are integrated throughout the development process
- **Performance Awareness**: All contributions must consider performance impact on production systems
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Changes must maintain compliance with financial regulations
- **Thorough Testing**: Comprehensive testing is required at all levels

### Development Environment Setup

#### Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL 12+ with required extensions:
  - `uuid-ossp` for UUID generation
  - `pg_stat_statements` for performance monitoring
  - `pg_cron` for automated scheduling (optional)
- Access to staging environment that mirrors production
- Git with proper configuration
- Code editor with SQL syntax highlighting

#### Local Environment Configuration
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd data-strategy-rently

# Set up local database
createdb rently_lending_dev
psql -d rently_lending_dev -f rently_lending_enhanced_v1.sql

# Run initial tests
psql -d rently_lending_dev -f test_suite.sql
```

## Branching Strategy

### Branch Types

#### Main Branches
- **`main`**: Production-ready code, always deployable
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features, pre-production testing

#### Supporting Branches
- **`feature/*`**: New features and enhancements
- **`bugfix/*`**: Bug fixes for existing functionality
- **`hotfix/*`**: Critical fixes that need immediate deployment
- **`release/*`**: Release preparation and final testing

### Naming Conventions
```
feature/TICKET-123-add-payment-analytics
bugfix/TICKET-456-fix-dpd-calculation
hotfix/TICKET-789-critical-security-fix
release/v2.1.0-enhanced-dashboard
```

### Branch Lifecycle

#### Feature Development
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Submit pull request to `develop`
4. Code review and testing
5. Merge to `develop` after approval

#### Release Process
1. Create release branch from `develop`
2. Final testing and bug fixes
3. Update version numbers and documentation
4. Merge to `main` and tag release
5. Deploy to production
6. Merge changes back to `develop`

#### Hotfix Process
1. Create hotfix branch from `main`
2. Implement fix with tests
3. Emergency review process
4. Merge to both `main` and `develop`
5. Tag and deploy immediately

    l.principal_amount,
    p.display_name as borrower_name,
    COUNT(pa.id) as payment_count,
    SUM(pa.allocated_amount) as total_paid
FROM loan l
JOIN party p ON l.borrower_party_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN payment_allocation pa ON l.id = pa.loan_id
WHERE l.status = 'active'
  AND l.start_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY l.loan_number, l.principal_amount, p.display_name
ORDER BY l.loan_number;

-- Bad: Poor formatting
select l.loan_number,l.principal_amount,p.display_name,count(pa.id),sum(pa.allocated_amount) from loan l join party p on l.borrower_party_id=p.id left join payment_allocation pa on l.id=pa.loan_id where l.status='active' group by l.loan_number,l.principal_amount,p.display_name;
```

#### Performance Standards
- All queries must use appropriate indexes
- Avoid N+1 query patterns
- Use materialized views for complex aggregations
- Include EXPLAIN ANALYZE output for complex queries
- Set appropriate timeout limits

#### Error Handling
```sql
-- Always include error handling in functions
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION process_payment(p_payment_id UUID)
RETURNS boolean AS $$
DECLARE
    payment_record payment%ROWTYPE;
BEGIN
    -- Input validation
    IF p_payment_id IS NULL THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Payment ID cannot be null';
    END IF;
    
    -- Get payment record
    SELECT * INTO payment_record FROM payment WHERE id = p_payment_id;
    
    IF NOT FOUND THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Payment not found: %', p_payment_id;
    END IF;
    
    -- Process payment logic here
    
    RETURN TRUE;
    
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        -- Log error details
        RAISE LOG 'Error processing payment %: %', p_payment_id, SQLERRM;
        RETURN FALSE;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Documentation Standards

#### SQL Comments
```sql
-- Single line comments for brief explanations
SELECT * FROM loan WHERE status = 'active'; -- Only active loans

/*
 * Multi-line comments for complex logic or business rules
 * This query calculates the effective payment rate by comparing
 * actual payments received against the scheduled payment amounts
 * based on the amortization schedule.
 */
```

#### Business Rule Documentation
```sql
/*
 * BUSINESS RULE: Payment Allocation Priority
 * 1. Penalties (highest priority)
 * 2. Interest charges
 * 3. Fees (RC fees, late fees)
 * 4. Principal (lowest priority)
 * 
 * This ensures regulatory compliance and matches
 * business expectations for payment processing.
 */
