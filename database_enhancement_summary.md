## Major Enhancements Overview

### 1. Enhanced Product Categorization
**Problem Solved**: The original generic `product` table lacked specific categorization for Rently's diverse business lines.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `category` field with values: `rently_care_d2c`, `rently_care_collaborative`, `b2b_sme`, `rnpl_uae`
- Added `subcategory` field for product variants
- Added `business_unit` field with values: `residential`, `commercial`
- Added `is_active` flag for product lifecycle management

**Business Impact**: Enables precise product performance tracking, reporting segmentation, and business unit analysis.

### 2. Operational Status Management System
**Problem Solved**: No systematic tracking of loan operational status changes, risk levels, and collections stages.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **New Table**: `loan_status_history` for comprehensive status tracking
- Status types: `risk_level`, `collections_stage`, `legal_action`, `operational_status`
- Temporal tracking with `effective_from` and `effective_through` dates
- Audit trail with `created_by` and `reason` fields

**Business Impact**: Enables proactive risk management, automated escalation workflows, and regulatory compliance reporting.

### 3. Enhanced Collections Management
**Problem Solved**: Basic collections tracking insufficient for sophisticated recovery workflows.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced `collections_event` table with:
  - `consecutive_missed_payments` for escalation triggers
  - `escalation_trigger` for automated workflow rules
  - `resolution_status` for outcome tracking
  - `next_action_date` for workflow scheduling
  - `notes` for detailed case management
- Expanded event types including legal actions and settlement management

**Business Impact**: Improves collection efficiency through systematic workflow management and automated escalation rules.

### 4. Rental-Specific Enhancements
**Problem Solved**: Generic loan structure didn't capture rental industry specifics.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added to `loan` table:
  - `installment_period` (e.g., "1/12", "2/12") for rental payment tracking
  - `lease_start_date` and `lease_end_date` for lease lifecycle management
  - `agent_party_id` for property agent relationship tracking
- Enhanced `party` table with agent and landlord roles

**Business Impact**: Enables rental-specific analytics, lease management, and agent performance tracking.

### 5. Dispute Management System
**Problem Solved**: No systematic approach to payment discrepancies and disputes.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **New Table**: `payment_disputes` for comprehensive dispute tracking
- Dispute types: amount mismatches, timing issues, allocation errors, unauthorized payments
- Priority-based assignment and resolution tracking
- Integration with payment and loan systems

**Business Impact**: Reduces payment processing errors and improves customer satisfaction through systematic dispute resolution.

### 6. Transfer Management
**Problem Solved**: Limited support for apartment transfers, lease renewals, and loan consolidation.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **New Table**: `loan_transfers` for transfer workflow management
- Transfer types: apartment changes, lease renewals, refinancing, consolidation
- Approval workflow with status tracking
- Integration with existing loan relationships

**Business Impact**: Streamlines customer lifecycle management and reduces manual processing for common rental scenarios.
