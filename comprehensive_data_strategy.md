# Comprehensive Data Strategy - Rently Lending Platform

## Executive Summary

This data strategy document provides a comprehensive analysis and strategic roadmap for Rently's lending platform data architecture. Based on the analysis of existing data models and loan software requirements, this strategy outlines key recommendations for data governance, architecture optimization, and business intelligence capabilities.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Data Model Strengths

1. **Well-Structured Core Entities**: The current data model provides comprehensive coverage of lending operations with 18 core tables
2. **Multi-Currency Support**: Built-in FX rate management and multi-currency transaction handling
3. **Flexible Party Management**: Supports various actor types (borrowers, guarantors, brokers, landlords)
4. **Comprehensive Payment Tracking**: Detailed payment allocation and amortization capabilities
5. **Document Management**: Flexible document linking to any entity type
6. **Audit Trail**: Collections events and ledger entries provide complete transaction history

### Current Data Model Coverage

#### Core Business Entities ✅
- **Legal Entity Management**: Multi-entity lending operations
- **Product Catalog**: Flexible loan product definitions  
- **Party Management**: Borrowers, guarantors, brokers, landlords
- **Application Workflow**: From application to decision to loan
- **Loan Lifecycle**: Complete loan management with refinancing support
- **Payment Processing**: Multi-currency payment handling with allocation
- **Collections Management**: Comprehensive recovery workflow tracking
- **Accounting**: Double-entry ledger with chart of accounts

#### Key Business Flows Supported ✅
1. Application → Decision → Loan Creation → Amortization Planning
2. Payment Receipt → Allocation → Ledger Entry Creation
3. Collections Management → Recovery Actions → Event Tracking
4. Multi-Currency Operations → FX Rate Management → Conversion

## Gap Analysis: Current Model vs Business Requirements

### Requirements from Loan Software Document

#### ✅ **Already Supported**
- Customer information tracking (`party` table)
- Application management (`application` table)
- Service/loan approval workflow (`decision`, `loan` tables)
- Payment scheduling (`amortisation_plan`, `amortisation_line`)
- Payment tracking (`payment`, `payment_allocation`)
- Bank/payment information (`payment_instrument`)
- Default tracking (via `collections_event`)

#### ⚠️ **Partially Supported / Needs Enhancement**

1. **Service Categories**: 
   - Current: Generic `product` table
   - Needed: Specific categorization for Rently Care D2C, Collaborative, B2B SME, RNPL UAE

2. **Repayment Plan Modifications**:
   - Current: Version-based `amortisation_plan`
   - Needed: Enhanced workflow for payment plan restructuring

3. **Dispute Management**:
   - Current: No dedicated dispute tracking
   - Needed: Payment discrepancy management

4. **Transfer Scenarios**:
   - Current: Basic loan refinancing via `parent_loan_id`
   - Needed: Enhanced support for apartment transfers, lease renewals

#### ❌ **Missing Components**

1. **Operational Status Tracking**:
   - Risk levels (Risk, Default Level 1, Default Level 2)
   - Lawyer letter status
   - Court case management

2. **Enhanced Collections Workflow**:
   - Automated escalation rules
   - Legal action tracking
   - Small claims case management

3. **Rental-Specific Fields**:
   - Installment period tracking (e.g., 1/12, 2/12)
   - Lease-specific dates and terms
   - Agent information management

## Strategic Recommendations

ALTER TABLE product ADD COLUMN subcategory TEXT;
ALTER TABLE product ADD COLUMN business_unit TEXT; -- 'residential', 'commercial'
```

**B. Operational Status Management**
```sql
-- New table for enhanced loan status tracking
CREATE TABLE loan_status_history (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    loan_id UUID REFERENCES loan(id),
    status_type TEXT, -- 'risk_level', 'collections_stage', 'legal_action'
    status_value TEXT, -- 'risk', 'default_level_1', 'lawyer_letter', etc.
    effective_from TIMESTAMP,
    effective_through TIMESTAMP,
    reason TEXT,
    created_by UUID REFERENCES party(id)
);
```

**C. Enhanced Collections Management**
```sql
-- Extend collections_event table
ALTER TABLE collections_event ADD COLUMN consecutive_missed_payments INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE collections_event ADD COLUMN escalation_trigger TEXT;
ALTER TABLE collections_event ADD COLUMN resolution_status TEXT;
ALTER TABLE collections_event ADD COLUMN next_action_date DATE;
```

**D. Rental-Specific Enhancements**
```sql
-- Add rental-specific fields to loan
ALTER TABLE loan ADD COLUMN installment_period TEXT; -- '1/12', '2/12', etc.
ALTER TABLE loan ADD COLUMN lease_start_date DATE;
ALTER TABLE loan ADD COLUMN lease_end_date DATE;
ALTER TABLE loan ADD COLUMN agent_party_id UUID REFERENCES party(id);
```

#### Medium Priority (Q2 2025)

**A. Dispute Management System**
```sql
CREATE TABLE payment_disputes (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    payment_id UUID REFERENCES payment(id),
    loan_id UUID REFERENCES loan(id),
    dispute_type TEXT, -- 'amount_mismatch', 'timing_issue', 'allocation_error'
    expected_amount NUMERIC,
    actual_amount NUMERIC,
    status TEXT, -- 'open', 'investigating', 'resolved', 'closed'
    reported_by UUID REFERENCES party(id),
    assigned_to UUID REFERENCES party(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    resolved_at TIMESTAMP,
    resolution_notes TEXT
);
```

**B. Enhanced Transfer Management**
```sql
CREATE TABLE loan_transfers (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    source_loan_id UUID REFERENCES loan(id),
