## Data Validation Testing

### Overview
Data validation testing ensures the integrity, quality, and consistency of all data stored in the Rently lending platform database.

### Validation Categories

#### 1. Schema Integrity Validation
**Purpose**: Verify database schema structure and constraints

**Test Areas**:
- Table structure completeness
- Foreign key relationships
- Check constraints
- Index presence and effectiveness
- Trigger functionality

**Execution**: 
```sql
-- Run comprehensive test suite
\i /path/to/test_suite.sql

-- Run specific schema tests
SELECT * FROM validate_schema_integrity();
```

**Success Criteria**:
- All expected tables present
- All foreign key constraints valid
- No orphaned records
- All indexes created and functional

#### 2. Business Rule Validation
**Purpose**: Ensure business logic compliance across all data operations

**Key Rules Tested**:
- Payment allocation totals equal payment amounts
- Loan date ranges are valid (end_date > start_date)
- Amortization schedules balance with loan principals
- Currency consistency across related records
- Interest rates within acceptable ranges
- Status transitions follow business logic

**Test Scenarios**:
```sql
-- Example: Validate payment allocation
WITH payment_validation AS (
    SELECT 
        p.id,
        p.amount,
        SUM(pa.allocated_amount) as total_allocated
    FROM payment p
    JOIN payment_allocation pa ON p.id = pa.payment_id
    WHERE p.status = 'completed'
    GROUP BY p.id, p.amount
)
SELECT COUNT(*) as violations
FROM payment_validation
WHERE ABS(amount - total_allocated) > 0.01;
```

#### 3. Data Quality Validation
**Purpose**: Ensure data completeness, accuracy, and consistency

**Quality Dimensions**:
- **Completeness**: Required fields populated
- **Accuracy**: Data formats and ranges correct
- **Consistency**: Related data matches across tables
- **Uniqueness**: No duplicate records where not allowed
- **Validity**: Data conforms to business rules

**Automated Checks**:
```sql
-- Run all data quality validations
SELECT * FROM validate_data_quality();

-- Check specific quality metrics
SELECT * FROM check_data_completeness();
SELECT * FROM validate_data_formats();
```

#### 4. Financial Calculation Validation
**Purpose**: Verify accuracy of all financial computations

**Key Calculations**:
- Interest calculations (simple and compound)
- Payment allocation logic
- Amortization schedule generation
- Foreign exchange conversions
- Fee calculations
- Balance computations

**Precision Requirements**:
- Monetary amounts: 2 decimal places precision
- Interest rates: 4 decimal places precision
- Exchange rates: 6 decimal places precision
- Allocation totals: Must balance within 0.01 currency units

## Migration Testing Procedures
