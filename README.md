## Usage

### Basic Operations

#### Creating a Loan Application

```sql
-- 1. Register borrower
INSERT INTO party (kind, display_name, email, phone) 
VALUES ('individual', 'John Doe', 'john@example.com', '+65-9123-4567');

-- 2. Create application
INSERT INTO application (
    application_number, product_id, legal_entity_id, 
    applicant_party_id, requested_amount, requested_currency, tenor_months
) VALUES (
    'APP-' || generate_random_uuid()::text,
    (SELECT id FROM product WHERE code = 'RC_D2C_001'),
    (SELECT id FROM legal_entity WHERE country_code = 'SG'),
    (SELECT id FROM party WHERE email = 'john@example.com'),
    50000.00, 'SGD', 12
);

-- 3. Record approval decision
INSERT INTO decision (
    application_id, outcome, approved_amount, 
    approved_currency, decided_by
) VALUES (
    (SELECT id FROM application WHERE application_number LIKE 'APP-%'),
    'approved', 50000.00, 'SGD', 'system'
);
```

#### Processing Payments

```sql
-- Record incoming payment
INSERT INTO payment (
    legal_entity_id, currency_code, amount, direction,
    payer_party_id, received_at, status
) VALUES (
    (SELECT id FROM legal_entity WHERE country_code = 'SG'),
    'SGD', 2500.00, 'inbound',
    (SELECT id FROM party WHERE email = 'john@example.com'),
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'completed'
);

-- Allocate payment to loan
INSERT INTO payment_allocation (
    payment_id, loan_id, component, allocated_amount
) VALUES (
    (SELECT id FROM payment ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1),
    (SELECT id FROM loan WHERE borrower_party_id = 
        (SELECT id FROM party WHERE email = 'john@example.com')),
    'principal', 2500.00
);
```

### Analytics and Reporting

#### Portfolio Overview
```sql
-- Get portfolio summary by category
SELECT * FROM v_loan_portfolio_overview 
ORDER BY active_loan_count DESC;

-- Check payment health
SELECT * FROM v_payment_health_summary 
WHERE risk_category != 'Normal';

-- View collections performance
SELECT * FROM v_collections_performance 
WHERE reporting_month = EXTRACT(MONTH FROM CURRENT_DATE);
```

#### Cash Flow Analysis
```sql
-- Weekly cash flow projections
SELECT * FROM v_weekly_cash_flow_projections 
WHERE week_start_date >= CURRENT_DATE 
ORDER BY week_start_date;

-- Currency risk assessment
SELECT * FROM v_currency_risk_analysis 
WHERE risk_level IN ('High', 'Very High');
```

### Dashboard Queries

The platform includes 11 comprehensive dashboards. Sample queries for each dashboard are available in [sample_dashboard_queries.sql](sample_dashboard_queries.sql).

```sql
-- Executive dashboard summary
SELECT * FROM v_executive_summary_dashboard;

-- Risk analytics overview
SELECT * FROM v_portfolio_concentration_analysis;

-- Collections performance metrics
SELECT * FROM v_collections_resolution_analysis 
WHERE resolution_month >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '6 months';
```

SELECT initialize_monitoring_system();

-- Run health checks
SELECT * FROM run_system_health_check();

-- Performance monitoring
SELECT * FROM v_performance_monitoring_dashboard;
```

### Maintenance Procedures
```bash
# Daily maintenance
psql -d rently_lending -c "SELECT refresh_materialized_views();"
psql -d rently_lending -c "SELECT run_daily_validation_checks();"

# Weekly optimization
psql -d rently_lending -c "SELECT optimize_database_performance();"

# Monthly reporting
psql -d rently_lending -c "SELECT generate_monthly_portfolio_report();"
```

## API Reference

### Core Endpoints

The system exposes RESTful APIs for all major operations:

- `GET /api/v1/loans` - Retrieve loan portfolio
- `POST /api/v1/applications` - Create new application  
- `GET /api/v1/payments/{id}` - Get payment details
- `POST /api/v1/collections/events` - Log collections activity
- `GET /api/v1/analytics/dashboard/{type}` - Retrieve dashboard data

For complete API documentation, see [API_DOCUMENTATION.md](API_DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions with principle of least privilege
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all data modifications
- **Compliance**: GDPR/PDPA compliant with data retention policies

### Security Features
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Database connection encryption (SSL/TLS)
- Sensitive field masking based on user roles
- Automated security monitoring and alerting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Performance Issues
```sql
-- Check for table bloat
SELECT * FROM v_table_maintenance_status;

-- Analyze query performance
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE calls > 100 ORDER BY mean_time DESC;
```

#### Data Integrity Issues
```sql
-- Run validation checks
SELECT * FROM run_all_validations();

-- Check constraint violations
SELECT * FROM v_data_quality_monitoring;
```

#### Connection Issues
```bash
# Check database connections
psql -d rently_lending -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# Monitor connection pooling
# Check pgBouncer stats if using connection pooling
```
