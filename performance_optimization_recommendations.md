## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive performance optimization recommendations for the Rently Lending Platform analytics workloads. The recommendations focus on PostgreSQL best practices, materialized view strategies, and efficient query patterns to support high-performance reporting across operational, risk, and executive dashboards.

### Key Performance Targets
- **Tier 1 Dashboards**: <3 seconds response time, real-time data
- **Tier 2 Dashboards**: <5 seconds response time, near real-time data  
- **Tier 3 Reports**: <10 seconds response time, acceptable latency
- **Concurrent Users**: 100+ simultaneous dashboard users
- **System Availability**: >99.5% uptime for analytics layer

### Optimization Impact Projections
- **Query Performance**: 70-90% improvement in dashboard load times
- **System Throughput**: 3-5x increase in concurrent query capacity
- **Resource Utilization**: 40-60% reduction in CPU and I/O load
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Automated refresh and monitoring processes

## Current Performance Analysis

### Workload Characteristics

#### Query Patterns
```sql
-- High-frequency queries (1000+ executions/day)
- Portfolio overview queries (v_loan_portfolio_overview)
- Current loan status queries (v_current_loan_status_summary) 
- DPD analysis queries (v_dpd_analysis)
- Collections performance queries (v_collections_performance)

-- Medium-frequency queries (100-500 executions/day)  
- Cash flow projections (v_weekly_cash_flow_projections)
- Risk analytics (v_portfolio_concentration_analysis)
- Executive dashboard queries (v_executive_summary_dashboard)

-- Low-frequency queries (<100 executions/day)
- ML feature engineering (v_ml_features_default_prediction)
- Compliance reports (v_regulatory_compliance_report)
- Vintage analysis (v_portfolio_quality_metrics)
```

#### Data Volume Projections
| Table | Current Est. | 1-Year Growth | 3-Year Growth | Key Drivers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **loan** | 50,000 | 200,000 | 1,000,000 | Business expansion |
| **payment** | 500,000 | 2,000,000 | 10,000,000 | Payment frequency |
| **collections_event** | 100,000 | 500,000 | 2,500,000 | Default rates |
| **payment_allocation** | 800,000 | 3,200,000 | 16,000,000 | Payment complexity |
| **amortisation_line** | 1,500,000 | 6,000,000 | 30,000,000 | Loan schedules |

#### Performance Bottlenecks Identified
1. **Complex Joins**: Multi-table views with 5+ table joins
2. **Aggregation Heavy**: SUM/COUNT operations across large datasets
3. **Date Range Filtering**: Historical analysis queries
4. **Subquery Dependencies**: Nested subqueries in analytical views
5. **Real-time Requirements**: Immediate data freshness needs

## Database Optimization Strategy

### PostgreSQL Configuration Tuning

#### Memory Configuration
```sql
-- Recommended postgresql.conf settings for analytics workload
-- Adjust based on available system memory (assuming 32GB+ server)

shared_buffers = '8GB'                    -- 25% of system memory
effective_cache_size = '24GB'             -- 75% of system memory  
work_mem = '256MB'                        -- Per-operation memory
maintenance_work_mem = '2GB'              -- Maintenance operations
max_connections = 200                     -- Support dashboard users
random_page_cost = 1.5                    -- SSD storage optimization

-- Query planner settings
effective_io_concurrency = 200            -- SSD concurrent I/O
max_parallel_workers = 8                  -- Parallel query workers
max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4       -- Per-query parallelism
```

#### Checkpoint and WAL Optimization
```sql
-- Write-Ahead Logging optimization
wal_level = replica
max_wal_size = '4GB'
min_wal_size = '1GB'
checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9
wal_compression = on

-- Background writer optimization
bgwriter_delay = 200ms
bgwriter_lru_maxpages = 100
bgwriter_lru_multiplier = 2.0
```

### Connection Pool Optimization

#### PgBouncer Configuration
```ini
# pgbouncer.ini settings for analytics workloads
pool_mode = transaction
max_client_conn = 500
default_pool_size = 25
server_round_robin = 1
query_timeout = 30
query_wait_timeout = 120

# Connection limits by database
analytics_db = host=localhost dbname=rently_lending user=analytics_user pool_size=50
```

## Query Optimization

### View Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Optimized Complex Joins
```sql
-- BEFORE: Complex nested subqueries
CREATE VIEW v_portfolio_performance_slow AS
SELECT 
    l.id,
    (SELECT SUM(pa.allocated_amount) FROM payment_allocation pa 
     JOIN payment p ON pa.payment_id = p.id 
     WHERE pa.loan_id = l.id AND p.status = 'completed') as total_payments,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM collections_event ce WHERE ce.loan_id = l.id) as collections_events
FROM loan l;

-- AFTER: Optimized with LEFT JOINs and aggregation
CREATE VIEW v_portfolio_performance_fast AS
SELECT 
    l.id,
    COALESCE(ps.total_payments, 0) as total_payments,
    COALESCE(cs.collections_events, 0) as collections_events
FROM loan l
LEFT JOIN mv_payment_summary_detailed ps ON l.id = ps.loan_id
LEFT JOIN mv_collections_summary_detailed cs ON l.id = cs.loan_id;
```

#### 2. Efficient Time-Range Queries
```sql
-- Optimized cash flow projection with date partitioning consideration
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v_cash_flow_optimized AS
WITH RECURSIVE date_series AS (
    SELECT CURRENT_DATE as projection_date
    UNION ALL
    SELECT projection_date + INTERVAL '1 week'
    FROM date_series
    WHERE projection_date < CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '12 weeks'
),
scheduled_payments AS (
    SELECT 
        ds.projection_date,
        al.currency_code,
        SUM(al.amount_principal + al.amount_rc_fee + al.amount_penalty + al.amount_other) as scheduled_amount
    FROM date_series ds
    JOIN amortisation_line al ON al.due_date >= ds.projection_date 
                             AND al.due_date < ds.projection_date + INTERVAL '1 week'
    JOIN amortisation_plan ap ON al.plan_id = ap.id AND ap.status = 'active'
    GROUP BY ds.projection_date, al.currency_code
)
SELECT * FROM scheduled_payments
ORDER BY projection_date, currency_code;
```

#### 3. Partitioned Table Strategies (Future Enhancement)
```sql
-- Partition large tables by date for better query performance
-- This would be implemented in a future schema enhancement

-- Example: Partition collections_event by month
CREATE TABLE collections_event_partitioned (
    LIKE collections_event INCLUDING ALL
) PARTITION BY RANGE (event_at);

-- Create monthly partitions
CREATE TABLE collections_event_2024_01 PARTITION OF collections_event_partitioned
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');

CREATE TABLE collections_event_2024_02 PARTITION OF collections_event_partitioned
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-02-01') TO ('2024-03-01');

-- Automated partition creation function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_monthly_partitions(table_name text, months_ahead integer)
RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
    start_date date;
    end_date date;
    partition_name text;
    i integer;
BEGIN
    FOR i IN 0..months_ahead LOOP
        start_date := DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE + (i || ' months')::interval);
        end_date := start_date + INTERVAL '1 month';
        partition_name := table_name || '_' || TO_CHAR(start_date, 'YYYY_MM');
        
        EXECUTE format('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS %I PARTITION OF %I 
                       FOR VALUES FROM (%L) TO (%L)',
                       partition_name, table_name, start_date, end_date);
    END LOOP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Query Performance Patterns

#### 1. Use of EXPLAIN ANALYZE for Monitoring
```sql
-- Create view performance monitoring
CREATE TABLE query_performance_log (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    query_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    execution_time_ms NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    rows_returned BIGINT,
    query_plan TEXT,
    executed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Function to log slow queries
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_slow_query(
    p_query_name text,
    p_execution_time_ms numeric,
    p_rows_returned bigint DEFAULT NULL,
    p_query_plan text DEFAULT NULL
) RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO query_performance_log (query_name, execution_time_ms, rows_returned, query_plan)
    VALUES (p_query_name, p_execution_time_ms, p_rows_returned, p_query_plan);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### 2. Query Result Caching Strategy
```sql
-- Application-level caching recommendations
-- Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed dashboard data

-- Cache configuration (pseudo-code for application)
/*
Cache Tiers:
- Tier 1 (1-5 minute TTL): Executive dashboard, portfolio overview
- Tier 2 (5-15 minute TTL): Risk analytics, collections performance  
- Tier 3 (1-24 hour TTL): Historical analysis, ML features

Cache Keys Pattern:
- dashboard:portfolio:overview:{legal_entity_id}:{currency}
- analytics:risk:concentration:{date}
- report:compliance:{legal_entity_id}:{report_date}
*/
```

    (SELECT ROUND(AVG(mean_exec_time), 2) FROM pg_stat_statements 
     WHERE query LIKE '%v_%' AND calls > 10) as avg_view_exec_time_ms,
    
    -- Cache hit ratios
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(blks_hit) / NULLIF(SUM(blks_hit + blks_read), 0), 2) as cache_hit_ratio_pct,
    
    -- Materialized view freshness
    (SELECT MAX(EXTRACT(minutes FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - last_updated)) 
     FROM mv_current_loan_status_realtime) as oldest_mv_age_minutes
     
FROM pg_stat_database 
WHERE datname = 'rently_lending';

-- Alerting thresholds
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_performance_alerts()
RETURNS TABLE (
    alert_type text,
    alert_level text,
    alert_message text,
    metric_value numeric
) AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    WITH metrics AS (SELECT * FROM v_performance_monitoring)
    SELECT 
        'Connection Pool' as alert_type,
        CASE WHEN active_connections > 150 THEN 'CRITICAL'
             WHEN active_connections > 100 THEN 'WARNING'
             ELSE 'OK' END as alert_level,
        'Active connections: ' || active_connections::text as alert_message,
        active_connections as metric_value
    FROM metrics
    WHERE active_connections > 100
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT 
        'Cache Performance' as alert_type,
        CASE WHEN cache_hit_ratio_pct < 90 THEN 'CRITICAL'

    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT 
        'Materialized Views' as alert_type,
        CASE WHEN oldest_mv_age_minutes > 10 THEN 'CRITICAL'
