    LEGAL_ENTITY ||--o{ PAYMENT : processes
    LEGAL_ENTITY ||--o{ APPLICATION : handles
    
    PRODUCT ||--o{ APPLICATION : for
    PRODUCT ||--o{ LOAN : defines
    
    PARTY ||--|| APPLICATION : submits
    PARTY ||--o{ LOAN : borrows
    PARTY ||--o{ PARTY_ROLE : plays
    PARTY ||--o{ PAYMENT : makes

- **Foreign Key**: All foreign key relationships indexed for join performance
- **Business Key**: Unique business identifiers (loan numbers, application numbers)

#### Performance Indexes
```sql
-- High-frequency query optimization
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_loan_status_borrower ON loan(status, borrower_party_id);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_payment_received_status ON payment(received_at, status);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_collections_event_loan_dpd ON collections_event(loan_id, dpd_snapshot);

-- Analytics optimization
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_loan_start_date_product ON loan(start_date, product_id);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_payment_allocation_component ON payment_allocation(component, allocated_amount);
```

#### Partial Indexes
```sql
-- Active records only
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_loan_active ON loan(status) WHERE status = 'active';
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_party_active ON party(is_active) WHERE is_active = true;
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_payment_pending ON payment(status) WHERE status = 'pending';
```

### Data Partitioning Strategy

#### Time-Based Partitioning
```sql
-- Large transaction tables partitioned by month
CREATE TABLE payment_y2024m01 PARTITION OF payment
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');

CREATE TABLE ledger_entry_y2024m01 PARTITION OF ledger_entry
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');
```

#### Range Partitioning
```sql
-- Collections events by DPD ranges
CREATE TABLE collections_event_current PARTITION OF collections_event
    FOR VALUES FROM (0) TO (31);
    
CREATE TABLE collections_event_overdue PARTITION OF collections_event
    FOR VALUES FROM (31) TO (91);
```

## Data Flow Architecture

### Event-Driven Processing

#### Event Types
- **Loan Events**: Application submitted, loan approved, loan closed
- **Payment Events**: Payment received, allocation completed, dispute raised
- **Collections Events**: Overdue detected, reminder sent, legal action initiated
- **System Events**: Data validation, reconciliation, backup completed

#### Event Processing Pipeline

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API
    participant Service
    participant Database
    participant Queue
    participant Analytics
    participant Notification
    
    Client->>API: Submit Request
    API->>Service: Process Business Logic
    Service->>Database: Persist Changes
    Service->>Queue: Publish Event
    Queue->>Analytics: Update Views
    Queue->>Notification: Send Alerts
    Analytics-->>Client: Real-time Dashboard Update
```

- **Use Cases**: Regulatory reports, historical analysis, data warehouse updates
- **Technology**: Scheduled jobs, ETL pipelines, bulk data processing

### Analytics Architecture

#### Materialized Views Strategy

```sql
-- Real-time operational views
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW v_active_loans_summary AS
SELECT 
    product_id,
    COUNT(*) as active_count,
    SUM(principal_amount) as total_principal,
    AVG(interest_rate) as avg_rate
FROM loan 
WHERE status = 'active'
GROUP BY product_id;

-- Refresh every 5 minutes

```

#### Data Masking
```sql
-- Dynamic data masking for sensitive fields
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v_party_masked AS
SELECT 
    id,
    kind,
    display_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN current_user_has_role('rently_executive') THEN email
        ELSE regexp_replace(email, '(.{2}).*@', '\1***@')
    END as email,
    CASE 
        WHEN current_user_has_role('rently_executive') THEN phone

#### Health Check Endpoints
```sql
-- System health check function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION system_health_check()
RETURNS JSON AS $$
DECLARE
    result JSON;
BEGIN
    SELECT json_build_object(
        'database_status', 'healthy',
        'connection_count', (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity),

#### Alerting Rules
```yaml
# Prometheus alerting rules
groups:
- name: rently-lending
  rules:
  - alert: HighDatabaseConnections
    expr: pg_stat_database_numbackends > 150
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: High database connection count
      
  - alert: SlowQueryDetected
    expr: pg_stat_statements_mean_time_ms > 5000
    for: 1m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: Slow query detected in database
```

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

#### Database Scaling
- **Read Replicas**: Multiple read replicas for analytical workloads
- **Partitioning**: Table partitioning for large datasets
- **Sharding**: Future sharding strategy for extreme scale
- **Connection Pooling**: Connection multiplexing for efficiency

#### Application Scaling
- **Microservices**: Service decomposition for independent scaling
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes for dynamic scaling
- **Load Balancing**: Traffic distribution across instances
- **Caching**: Distributed caching for performance

### Vertical Scaling

#### Database Server Scaling
- **CPU Scaling**: Multi-core processors for parallel processing
- **Memory Scaling**: Large memory pools for caching
- **Storage Scaling**: High-performance SSD arrays
- **Network Scaling**: High-bandwidth network interfaces

#### Application Server Scaling
- **Instance Sizing**: Right-sizing based on workload patterns
- **Resource Allocation**: Dynamic resource allocation
- **Performance Tuning**: JVM/runtime optimization
- **Monitoring**: Resource utilization monitoring

### Future Architecture Evolution

#### Microservices Migration

    end
    
    subgraph "Future Microservices Architecture"
        AUTH_SVC[Authentication Service]
        LOAN_SVC[Loan Service]
        PAYMENT_SVC[Payment Service]
        COLLECTIONS_SVC[Collections Service]
        ANALYTICS_SVC[Analytics Service]
        NOTIFICATION_SVC[Notification Service]
    end
    
    MONOLITH --> AUTH_SVC
    MONOLITH --> LOAN_SVC
    MONOLITH --> PAYMENT_SVC
    MONOLITH --> COLLECTIONS_SVC
    MONOLITH --> ANALYTICS_SVC
    MONOLITH --> NOTIFICATION_SVC
```

#### Cloud-Native Evolution
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes for service management
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for service-to-service communication
- **Event Streaming**: Kafka for event-driven architecture
- **Serverless Functions**: Lambda functions for event processing

#### Advanced Analytics
- **Data Lake**: S3-based data lake for historical analysis
- **Machine Learning**: ML pipelines for predictive analytics
- **Stream Processing**: Real-time stream processing for events
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j for relationship analysis
