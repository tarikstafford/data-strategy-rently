  --verbose --format=custom --compress=9 \
  --file=/opt/rently-migration/backups/rently_lending_pre_migration_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).backup

# Verify backup integrity
pg_restore --list /opt/rently-migration/backups/rently_lending_pre_migration_*.backup
```

#### **Step 1.3: Staging Environment Testing**
```sql

\i /opt/rently-migration/scripts/migration_testing_procedures.sql
SELECT * FROM run_complete_migration_test();
```

### **Phase 2: Schema Migration**

#### **Step 2.1: Pre-Migration Validation**

-- Connect to production database
\c rently_lending

-- Run pre-migration checks
\i /opt/rently-migration/scripts/migration_v0_to_v1.sql
SELECT * FROM run_pre_migration_validation();
```

#### **Step 2.2: Migration Execution**
```sql
-- Execute migration with monitoring
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM execute_migration_with_monitoring();
-- Review results before committing
COMMIT;
```

#### **Step 2.3: Post-Migration Validation**
```sql
